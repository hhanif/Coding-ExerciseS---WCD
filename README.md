# Coding-Exercises---WCD
My solutions for the two coding exercises for the Senior Web Content Developer Role at Gap Inc.

Here are the instructions regarding the coding exercises:
First unzip the folder
1. Nav Bar:

Inside the Nav folder will be an index.html with all of my code. There is also a folder with all of the optional landing pages inside of it.

2. JavaScript Function to Node Module:

Please download both files from the second folder. Open a terminal window into the folder with both files in it and use the command “node test.js” to test that the files are working correctly.
